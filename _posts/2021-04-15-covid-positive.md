title: Tested covid positive
---

I was thinking that if I wouldn't catch covid during March 2021, I would probably never catch it, March was a lot more risky than expected.  The most crazy was probably at the 14th of March when my son was participating in some performance and I had to enter a theatre hall.  Well, what can I say ... at least some few in the audience did cover both the mouth and the nose correctly with a face mask ...

The week after I travelled to Norway with my family, an awkward journey - St.Petersburg - Ivangorod - Narva - Tallinn - Warzawa - Oslo, nobody wearing face masks on the first bus journey, the taxi driver whom took us to Tallinn airport also didn't wear a mask.  And still - no corona!  I tested negative over and over and over again!

I did manage to catch something else, though - the common cold virus.  My daughter probably brought it from school, my youngest son got it from her (and had a fever and running nose at that day when we were passing three country borders and taking two airplanes ... we were lucky that the body temperature wasn't checked anywhere), and I got it from him.  I hate going around caughing and having a running nose - but it's even worse during a pandemic.

We had some social contact during the easter holidays.  By the end of the easter holidays I drove my family to the airport using a self-service rental car.  I forgot to disinfect the steering wheel, and without thinking I was scratching my nose while driving.  I cannot be completely sure that's how it happened, but this seems to be the most likely way I ended up catching the corona virus. One week later (2021-04-11), just as I had completely recovered from my round of the common cold, I woke up ill again.  I did yet another covid test, and it was positive.

Waking up with fever was a big surprise - how could I catch anything when I almost hadn't had any social contact for more than a week?  I reached out to everyone I've been in touch with during the easter, everybody was healthy.  It's so completely unexpected - like in a comic, when someone feels lucky after surviving a dangerous journey, just to be killed by a falling piano.  The positive test result didn't surprise me much though.  I was even happy that the test came out positive - at least this time I'm getting some useful antibodies in return from being ill, and this time I know for sure what virus is bugging me.
