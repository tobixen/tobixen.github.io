title: Tested covid positive
---

The probability that I would catch covid during March 2021 was much higher than what I'd wanted it to be.  The most crazy was probably at the 14th of March when my son was participating in some performance and I had to enter a theatre hall.  Well, what can I say ... at least some few in the audience did cover both the mouth and the nose correctly with a face mask ...

The week after I travelled to Norway with my family - this time the trip involved two longer bus journeys (with nobody wearing masks on one of the buses), one taxi trip with a taxi driver that didn't wear a mask, and two flights.  And still - no corona!  I tested negative before the journey, after the journey and once more a week later.

I did manage to catch something else, though - the common cold virus.  My daughter brought it from school, my youngest son got it from her (and had a fever and running nose at that day when we were passing three country borders and taking two airplanes ... we were lucky that the body temperature wasn't checked anywhere), and I got it from him.  I hate going around caughing and having a running nose - but it's even worse during a pandemic.

We had some social contact in the easter holidays.  By the end of the easter holidays I drove my family to the airport using a self-service rental car.  I forgot to disinfect the steering wheel, and without thinking I was scratching my nose while driving.  I cannot be completely sure that's how it happened, this seems to be the most likely way I ended up catching the corona virus. One week later (2021-04-11), just as I had almost completely recovered from my round of the common cold, I woke up ill again.  I did another covid test, it was positive.

Waking up with fever was a big surprise - how could I catch anything when I almost hadn't had any social contact for more than a week?  I reached out to everyone I've been in touch with during the easter, everybody was healthy.  It's so completely unexpected - like in a comic, when someone feels lucky after surviving a dangerous journey, just to be killed by a falling piano.  The positive test result didn't surprise me much though - what else could it be?  I was even happy that the test came out positive - at least this time I'm getting some useful antibodies in return from being ill, and this time I know what it is that's bugging me.
