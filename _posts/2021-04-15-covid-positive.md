title: Tested covid positive
---

The probability that I would catch covid during March 2021 was much higher than what I'd wanted it to be.  The most crazy was probably at the 14th of March when son was having some performance and I had to enter this theatre hall:

(Yes, face masks are mandatory ... and it's supposed to cover the mouth and the nose, but people in that theatre didn't seem to care).  Next week I did two bus journeys taking several hours (with nobody wearing masks on one of the buses), one taxi trip with a taxi driver that didn't wear a mask, a two-legged plane journey and a short train journey.  And still - no corona!  I tested negative before the journey, after the journey and a week later.

I did manage to catch something else, though - the common cold virus.  My daughter brought it from school, my youngest son got it from her (and had a fever and running nose at that day when we were passing three country borders and taking two airplanes ... we were lucky that the body temperature wasn't checked anywhere), and I got it from him.  I hate going around caughing and having a running nose - but it's even worse during a pandemic.

We had some social contact in the easter holidays, and by the end of the easter holidays I drove my family to the airport using a self-service rental car.  I forgot to disinfect the steering wheel, and without thinking I was scratching my nose while driving ... and while I cannot be completely sure that's how it happened, this seems to be the most likely way I ended up catching the corona virus. One week later (2021-04-11), just as I had almost completely recovered from my round of the common cold, I woke up ill again.  I did another covid test, and two days later I was told it's positive.

I was very much surprised that morning when I woke up with fever, how could I catch anything when I almost hadn't had any social contact for more than a week?  I reached out to everyone I've been in touch with during the easter and after, everybody was healthy.  And after all I've been through ... it feels a bit like I've coming home alive after being out in a war-zone, just to be killed by a falling piano outside my own doorsteps.  The positive test result didn't surprise me much, after all I knew whatever I had caught must be highly contagious - what else could it be?  I was also a bit relieved to learn it was Covid - better with a known problem than an unknown problem, and when I'm anyway ill, at least I'm getting some useful antibodies this time.
